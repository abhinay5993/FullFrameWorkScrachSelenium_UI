/*
 * 
 * Write a program which will print the below structures according to the input provided to the program. 
 * The program should accept 3 inputs in the form of numbers between 1 and 9, both inclusive (one number per line) 
 * and then generate the corresponding structures based on the input.
 * 
 * Suppose the following sequence of numbers is supplied to the program:
 * 3
 * 2
 * 4
 * 
 * Then the output should be:
 *  1
 *  1
 *  2 2
 * 
 *   1
 *  2 2
 * 3 3 3
 * 
 *    1
 *   2 2
 *  3 3 3
 * 4 4 4 4
 * 
 * IMPORTANT NOTES - READ CAREFULLY:
 * 1. Your solution should assume console input
 * 2. Your solution should contain class name as Main, as the solution will be compiled as Main.java
